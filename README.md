## Getting Started
Install srteamlit ,sklearn,pandas,numpy packages and create a conda environment.

## Dataset
The "Ecommerce Customers" dataset is a fictional dataset often used for educational purposes, data analysis practice, and machine learning tutorials. It simulates customer data for an e-commerce company and includes various features that represent customer characteristics and behavior. Below is an overview of the typical features included in this dataset:

## Model Selection
LinearRegression model is selected.
Reason:The freatures are linearly dependent with the target variable.

## Training and Evaluation
The data is split into training and validation.
Training Size=350 samples
Testing Size=150 samples

## Results
Got mean squared error of 10.234
From the model co-efficients Time on website was the most importand feature.
